# Greenhouse Monitoring

The aim of this project was to implement an IoT environment logger for a greenhouse using a raspberry pi 3B+. The system collects various measurement data using analogue sensors at regular intervals. The data being collected for measrurement were light, temperature and humidity. the sensors used to collect these measurements interaacted with the raspberry pi through an ADC to convert the analogue sensor readings to values. In order to view these measurements remotely, Blynk(an IoT platform) was used to allow these mesurements to be monitored in real-time on an Android smartphone.
